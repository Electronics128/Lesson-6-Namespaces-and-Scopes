# Lesson 6: Namespaces and Scopes

This lesson focuses on Python’s namespaces and variable scopes. You’ll learn how variables are resolved and manipulated across different scopes (local, global, enclosing, and built-in).

## Objectives:
- Understand the LEGB (Local, Enclosing, Global, Built-in) resolution order.
- Use `global` and `nonlocal` keywords effectively.
- Avoid scope-related issues in functions.

## TODOs:
1. Work with global variables and access them in a function.
2. Understand local variables within a function.
3. Explore enclosing variables and nested functions.
4. Modify global variables using the `global` keyword.
5. Modify enclosing variables using the `nonlocal` keyword.
6. Observe variable shadowing and differentiate between scopes.
7. Use built-in modules and their scope.
8. Debug and fix scope-related issues.
9. Create nested namespaces and access them.
10. Demonstrate LEGB scope resolution in practice.

## How to Complete the Lesson:
1. Open `lesson_06.py` and complete the TODOs.
2. Run the script to test your functions.

## How to Test Your Code:
Run the test script to verify your solutions:

```bash
python3 test_lesson_06.py
